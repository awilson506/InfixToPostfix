 * 
 * This program takes in infix expressions from the input.txt 
 * and converts it to postfix using a stack and queue
 * to push, pop and enqueue elements in the proper order.
 * If the infix expression has a variable in
 * it, the user will be asked to enter the value for each 
 * variable until all of them have been substituted.  After the infix
 * expression has been converted it is evaluated and the output is 
 * printed to the ouput.txt file.
